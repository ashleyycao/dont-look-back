Welcome to Level 4: Pick Your Luck

You feel like there is someone in the forest and you have become scared. You see an abondoned cabin and try to break in to sleep over night. As you get closer to the cabin, you are being followed. You have to hurry up and lockpick the door to get in. To play this level you will need to input 12 perfect squares in 10 seconds. You are not allowed to repeat or you will be asked to try again until 10 seconds are up. If you input a number that is not a perfect square, it will display that it is not a perfect square and will be asked to input a perfect square until time is done. If time is not with you, you were too slow to lockpick the door and have been attacked by your follower. You will have to restart this level.
